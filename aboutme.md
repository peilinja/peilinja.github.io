### My story

Hi, I’m Peilin—I’m a data analyst, a cryptocurrency enthusiast. I graduated from East China Normal University with a master's degree in marine biology 🌊🐟and Hainan University with a bachelor's degree in aquaculture. After the graduate, my first experience is working as a consultant at Dr. Knoell Consult Shanghai Co. Ltd. However, in recent years, the information industry and housing prices have increased rapidly. Born in a small town🏠 in the middle of China and working in traditional industries, I feel great pressure in life🍐. Then I learned the *IBM Data Analyst professional certificate course* 📚 on Coursera on my own. 

My current work is focused on algorithms and models related to medical big data🏥.  The main contents include using SQL to extract data from databases, data Cleaning, develop models to ensuring the sensitivity of hospital-acquired infection monitoring and improving the accuracy of hospital-acquired infection monitoring, and using GPU to speed up the statistical calculation of medical big data. I love data science♥. 

Apart from them, I’m fond of rock music🎸 (Especially 70s&80s rock music), nature🌴, photography📷, and cryptocurrency.  I’ve always wanted to explore and try out new things. Reading and writing have always been my top interests. I will share my opinions, interests here. Feel free to follow me.
