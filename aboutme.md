### My story

Hi, I’m Peilin—I’m a data analyst, a cryptocurrency enthusiast. I graduated from East China Normal University with a master's degree in marine biology and Hainan University with a bachelor's degree in aquaculture. After the graduate, my first experience is working as a consultant at Dr. Knoell Consult Shanghai Co. Ltd. However, in recent years, the information industry and housing prices have increased rapidly. Born in a small town in the middle of China and working in traditional industries, I feel great pressure in life. Then I learned the IBM Data Analyst professional certificate course on Coursera myself. 

My current work is focused on algorithms and models related to medical big data.  The main contents include using SQL to extract data from databases, data Cleaning, develop models to ensuring the sensitivity of hospital-acquired infection monitoring and improving the accuracy of hospital-acquired infection monitoring, and using GPU to speed up the statistical calculation of medical big data. I love data science. 

Apart from them, I’m fond of rock music (Especially 70s&80s rock music), nature, photography, and cryptocurrency. I’ve always wanted to explore and try out new things. Reading and writing have always been my top interests. I will share my opinions, interests here. Feel free to follow me.
